## Why?

### Problem #1: easily mark things as purchased
* Previously, I used Trello. Here is how I had to mark things on Trello's mobile app:
  * Click on the item and wait for about half-a-second for it to "attach" itself to your touch
  * Drag it to the Archive area or to another list.
* With green-list:
  * Touch the item and it is marked as purchased

### Problem #2: What should I buy at the grocery store?
With green-list, you add items to your "All Items" list.

You can quickly search and/or scan that list to remind yourself of the things that you might need. And with a touch/click, you can add items to the shopping list.

## Future Goals
* Add categories: I should be able to type is _Costco_ and view all the items that I normally purchase there.
* Add stats: since I record when each item was purchased, the software should be able to say _"Hey, you usually buy paper towels once very 3 months. Its been 2 1/2 month. And you don't have it in your shopping list. Are you sure you don't need it?"_ with the ability to dismiss: _"No, I don't need it"_, _"Add it in the next shopping list, not the current one"_, or _"Remind me next month"_
* Make it Opinionated: _guide me_ into buying more greens & fresh foods.

## Tech
It is build with Meteor (https://meteor.com) and so everything is real-time.
